### IRingBufferScaleCapacity&lt;T&gt;.AutoScaleAcquireFault method
</br>


#### Sets the condition to autoscale (scale up) capacity when an acquire fault occurs. The Manually change scale will always return false if autoscale is enabled.

```csharp
public IRingBufferScaleCapacity AutoScaleAcquireFault(byte numberOfFaults = 1)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| numberOfFaults | Number of faults to trigger the scale-up. Default is 1 (after first fault). |

### Return Value

An instance of [`IRingBufferScaleCapacity`](../IRingBufferScaleCapacity-1.md).

### Remarks

The scale-up process is executed when the failure threshold defined by *numberOfFaults* is reached. The scaling down process is performed based on the initial capacity, minimum capacity or maximum capacity when the number of available buffers is greater than a value.

The scaledownwhen it is at minimum capacity is calculated using the formula: Minimum capacity - 2. If the value is less than 1 the value will be 1

The scaledown when it is at initial capacity is calculated using the formula: Initial capacity - Minimum capacity + 2

The scaledown when it is at maximum capacity is calculated using the formula: Maximum capacity - Initial capacity + 2

The scaledown process is executed when the following values ​​are reached after calculating the median of the samples(param.ref. int) within TimeSpan). [`ScaleTimer`](../IRingBuffer-1/ScaleTimer.md). /&gt;.

The autoscale (scale up or down) has timeout and uses the param.ref. TimeSpan of [`ScaleTimer`](../IRingBuffer-1/ScaleTimer.md). When the timeout is reached, the operation is undone.
